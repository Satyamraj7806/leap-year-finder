Leap Year Checker (C Program)
This is a simple C program that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not.

🧠 What is a Leap Year?
A leap year is:

Every year that is divisible by 4

Except years that are divisible by 100

Unless they are also divisible by 400

Examples:
✅ 2024 → Leap Year (divisible by 4, not by 100)

❌ 1900 → Not a Leap Year (divisible by 100, not by 400)

✅ 2000 → Leap Year (divisible by 400)
